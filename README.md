# juce_virtualmidi 

This module enables you to create virtual MIDI ports on both Windows and macOS. You can create MIDI ports on the fly by using a simple cross platform API.

Windows doesn't support virtual MIDI ports out of the box. To solve this we have written a custom Windows driver that can create MIDI ports on the fly.
